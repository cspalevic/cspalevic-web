> Fear - an unpleasant, often strong emotion caused by anticipation or awareness of danger

Fear is a primal instinct. It's a defense mechanism to help you survive. It keeps you from doing things that could potentially harm you. It's a good thing, in moderation. But, if you repeatedly do not
do things that scare you, you start to build a life inside invisible walls. How often do you notice that they're there? Fear creates a comfort zone. But it may just keep you from learning new things, having new experiences, and growing as a person. It may keep you from your true potential.

Why is it that we don't challenge ourselves more often? Why do we avoid doing things that scare us? It's uncomfortable, it's unpleasant. It's easier to stick to what we know.

But when you decide to do something that frightens you to your core, you realize something about yourself. You realize it wasn't so bad after all. Yeah, your
heart rate increased. Yeah, maybe you had a bit of a panic attack. But you did it, and you survived. You faced your fear and you came out the other side just fine.

After that, it hits you that your fear is superficial. It's not real. It's just a feeling in your mind. And you can overcome it.

When you challenge yourself to something at that kind of level, you recognize that you are more capable than you thought. It helps build your character and your confidence. Your boundaries begin to grow. You realize that most of the problems that you have actually don't even matter. Walking onto a stage, jumping out of a plane, starting a business, and having a difficult conversation. These things that once seemed impossible are now a walk in the park. You start to question what else you can do.

Your version of fear is different from mine. What scares one person may not scare another. But the point is to challenge yourself. To push your limits. To step outside of your comfort zone.

If it scares you, it's probably worth doing. You might just learn something about yourself. And you might just get a glimpse of how beautiful the world really is.
