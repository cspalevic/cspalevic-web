import { BlogHeader } from "@/components/blog-header";

export async function generateMetadata() {
  return {
    title: `Charlie Spalevic - First Blog Post`,
  };
}

<BlogHeader title="First Blog Post" date="07-16-2022" />

The obligatory first blog post!

I plan to add blogs based on the cool stuff I learn, very specific problems I solve, and my own experiences. I hope you find some of this useful.
